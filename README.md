# VoiceAssistantForYouTube


In this project, I've made a python script which will work as a voice assistant for youtube. 
We can play songs,videos just by saying 'Youtube play ....' 
This project is made using Python. 
Libraries used are: 
1. SpeechRecognition : Used to recognise the voice command passed by the user.
2. Pyttsx3 : Used to convert the text to speech. We will want our assistant to speak with us. Hence, this library is used.
3. PyAudio : We need to get our voice from microphone of our device. PyAudio is used for this function.
4. pywhatkit : This library helps to play songs, videos from YouTube.

For python versions of 3.6+ there is some problem while installing the PyAudio package. 
To solve this error use the following command: 
 pip install pipwin
 pipwin install PyAudio

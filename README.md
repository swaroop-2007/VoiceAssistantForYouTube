# VoiceAssistantForYouTube


In this project, I've made a python script which will work as a voice assistant for youtube. 
We can play songs,videos just by saying 'Youtube play ....' 
This project is made using Python. 
Libraries used are: 
1. SpeechRecognition
2. Pyttsx3
3. PyAudio

For python versions of 3.6+ there is some problem while installing the PyAudio package. 
To solve this error use the following command: 
 pip install pipwin
 pipwin install PyAudio
